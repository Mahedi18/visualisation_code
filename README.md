# Python-visualisation
Me learning Matplotlib and Seaborn
This repository contains Python code for various data visualization projects. These projects utilize popular Python libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to create visually appealing and insightful graphs, charts, and plots.

Project List
Bar Chart: Demonstrates the creation of a bar chart using Matplotlib to visualize categorical data.

Line Plot: Shows how to generate a line plot using Matplotlib to display the trend of continuous data over time.

Scatter Plot: Illustrates the use of Matplotlib to create a scatter plot, which is useful for visualizing the relationship between two numerical variables.

Heatmap: Utilizes the Seaborn library to generate a heatmap, a powerful tool for visualizing correlation and patterns in tabular data.

Pie Chart: Displays the creation of a pie chart using Matplotlib to represent proportions or percentages of a whole.

Interactive Plot: Demonstrates the use of Plotly to create an interactive plot with zoom and hover functionalities.

Usage
To run any of the visualization projects, simply navigate to the corresponding directory and execute the Python script. Make sure you have the required libraries installed by running pip install -r requirements.txt
